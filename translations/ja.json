It's a little bit unpredictable, still, whether LLMs will choose to perform a search. If they don't search, they may respond with (older) knowledge embedded in their weights, or a hallucination. Unlike function call hallucination, this is not particularly easy to fix with prompting. But it is easy to know whether a search was actually performed. So you can display that information in an application UI or inject it into the voice conversation. If your app relies on web search, doing this is a good idea. You're pushing the problem to the user to understand and deal with, but that's better than hiding the \"searched\" or \"didn't search\" distinction from the user.
